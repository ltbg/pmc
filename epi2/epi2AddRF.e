                          first 180.  Crushers were added to the left 180 to
                          avoid any performance derating.

12.0    12/03/04    TRS   MRIhc05228: Corrected scan time for DTI by setting
                          dda_pack to dda for non flair sequences.

12.0    12/13/04    TRS   MRIhc05259: Adjusted positioning and pws of the left

14.0    03/10/05    ZL    MRIhc06452: the applied the b-value in DSE case was
                          10% lower than opbval, due to the miscalculation
                          of Delta_time in DTI.e, fix has been made.

Value1.5T 04/08/05  KK    YMSmr06515: # of slice locations expansion

14.0	06/27/2005	 MRIhc08159: Added initializations of SCAN_INFO, RF_PULSE_INFO, PHYS_GRAD 
                         and LOG_GRAD. Also added explicit braces around if..else constructs the 
                         Vxworks compiler complained about

14.0  07/16/05 ZL        MRIhc05898: EPI sequence download failure for patient weight above 130kg  
                         with BODY or SURFACE coil on long bore system. This is caused by spsp pulse
                         , we can not stretch spsp pulse. The fix is to reduce flip angle when  
                         patient weight is above 130kg. This is a short term fix, a better
                         one would be designing a better spsp pulse.

                                 line triggering is not used.

20.0  10/10/2007 SWL MRIhc27257, MRIhc27350:  
                                 xtarg and vrgf_targ need to be readjusted 
                                 when tsp is below the hardware limit to prevent frequency 
                                 direction aliasing artifact at big FOV.  

20.0  10/11/2007 SWL MRIhc27255, MRIhc27359:  
                                 The num_overscan needs to be increased to 16

20.0  12/4/2007  SRW MRIhc28734  Use weighted diffusion averaging when diffusion
                                 lobes are active for less than 5 minutes on a 
                                 single axis.

                                 this can be overrided via a CV override_fatsat_high_weight.

20.0  06/10/2008 SWL MRIhc35951: The removal of SPSP RF pulse 3024850 caused minimum slice 
                                 thickness increase. The pull down menu for slice thickness 
                                 was adjusted. 

20.0  07/15/2008 SWL MRIhc38838: B0 dither calibration is removed for DVMR hardware. The EPI2

       rfov_type is determined in rfov_cveval() depending on acqs.
       But acqs is calculated in cveval1().
       If the condition is under marginally condition between 1acq and 2acqs
       the result of selection of rfov_type and acqs had conflict.
       That caused oscillation of results of cveval(), long UI response, wrong excitation
       and resulted in acquireing noise images.
       Detect oscillation here and set condition to larger acqs and smaller avmaxslquant.
       In predownload() no parameters should be changed, keep the oscillation mode flag
       and call cveval() from predownload() once oscillation is detected.
       Fix for HCSDM00361682 is rather tricky fix so appropriate fix with structual design change
       will be desired in the future. */

       the waveform such that it begins as a parabola, transitions smoothly
       into a linear segment covering the center portion of the transition,
       and transitions smoothly into a parabolic segment (a mirror of the
       first parabolic component) to terminate the transition.  This
       composite waveform and its first deriviative are continuous from
       start to end.   A parameter called "beta," ranging form 0 to 1,
       specifies the portion of the ramp that is linear.  If beta is 1,
       the ramp is completely linear; if zero, the ramp is completely
       parabolic.  As a greater portion of the waveform becomes parabolic,
       the slope of the linear segment increases.  The absolute area under
       the "ramp" transition remains constant for any value of beta over
       its range [0..1].
       
       Please refer to the 5.5 General PSD Enhancements SRS.
       
       The wave shaping is performed at the low level ramp generation
       routine (w_ramp funciton in wg_linear.c, PGEN_WAVE project).
       
       In the readout echo planar pulse train, the first attack and last
       decay ramp will have different shapes than the other ramps.
       For VRG sampling, this results in an assymmetry in the first and
       last view of the train.  To circumvent this, the dephaser pulse
       can be moved up against the readout train, and the dephaser's
       decay and be combined with the first readout attack ramp.

/* *******************************************************************
   CardInit
   RSP Subroutine

   Purpose:
   To create an array of deadtimes for each slice/phase of the first
   pass in a cardiac scan.  For multi-phase scans, this same array can be
   used as the slices are shuffled in each pass to obtain new phases.

   Description: The logic for creating the deadtime array for
   multiphase scans is rather simple.  All of the slices except the last
   slice have the same deadtime.  This deadtime will assure that the
   repetition time between slices equals the inter-sequence delay time.
   The last slice has a deadtime that will run the logic board until the
   beginning of the cardiac trigger window.

   The logic for creating the deadtime for single phase, or cross R-R
   scans, is much more complicated.  In these scans, the operator
   prescribes over how many R-R intervals (1-4) the slices should be
   interleaved over.  The deadtimes for the last slice in each R-R
   interval will be different depending on whether the R-R interval is
   filled, unfilled, or the last R-R interval. For example, lets say 14
   slices are to be interleaved among 4 R-R intervals.  4 slices will be
   placed in the first R-R, 4 in the second, 3 in the third, and 3 in the
   fourth.  This prescription has 2 filled R-R intervals, 1 unfilled R-R
   interval, and a final R-R interval.  The deadtimes for slices which
   are not the last slice in a R-R interval is the same deadtime that
   assures that the inter-sequence delay time is met.

   Parameters:
   (O) int ctlend_tab[]  table of deadtimes
   (I) int ctlend_intern deadtime needed to maintain intersequence delay time.
   Delay when next slice will be internally gated.
   (I) int ctlend_last   Delay time for last slice in ophrep beats.  Deadtime needed
   to get proper trigger delay for next heart beat. 
   (I) int ctlend_fill   Dead time for filled R-R interval.  Not used in multi-phase
